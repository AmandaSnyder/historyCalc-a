# historyCalc
This is the main project for IT 5236. It's a calculator. It is named historyCalc because being able to file i/o for operation history is a stretch goal for it.

To be implemented:

Immediate Goals:
-testing manually, in selenium, and in postman
-center text in divs and buttons
-stop collapsing on mobile layout for better usability
-display a warning message in a <noscript> tag to tell user to enable javascript



Stretch Goals:
-save and load history with text files
-implement additional math functions (modulus)
-improve UI color scheme
-make unimplemented functions display the text "WIP" upon hover, then go back to their original text when no longer hovered over.
-decrease navigation bar height and make better placeholders, perhaps with an external icon library
